# Project 02 - Using sagemaker pipeline to training ML model and saving artifact

This is demo project to express:
 - how using Sagemaker pipeline to implement full flow of ML application in getting data, processing/preparing data, feature engineering and training model.
 - This includes not only folder structure for source code storage, processing data log, but also code flow indicates how ProcessingStep and Pipeline are defined.
